**Inno-Centz/Inno-Centz** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently upskilling on how to be a proficient data analyst with ALX ''The Experience''

- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL a programming language for data analysis, which will provide me with cutting-edge skills in modelling and transforming data.

- 👯 I’m always looking to collaborate on data analysis projects where I can showcase my expertise in transforming data into actionable insights.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Aside from data analysis, you will find me serving aces on the tennis court or defending opponents on the football pitch.
